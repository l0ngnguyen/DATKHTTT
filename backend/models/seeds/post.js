          questionName:"How interlink external hyperlink/hotspot from WPF with internal hotspot on 3D object in Unity?",
          questionDetail: "I am still a beginner... I am trying to understand to what direction to dig with my current problem: There is a WPF app with an Element on canvas. There is a Unity 3D-walk-through 'game' with a 3D-model in it. \n What I am looking for is what command/line/etc should I look at to try to interlink both. Interlink would mean clicking on WPF's Element-hyperlink launches specific Unity-file and focuses(some visual action)on specific linked 3D-model in that file. /n From/to WPF is clear-hyperlinking to launch/open Unity file. The question is how it further link and vice versa how organize vice versa from Unity: click on subject/models/spot/etc brings me to specific point in WPF. /n Not knowing Unity I am trying to find the right direction/options to continue digging into... /n Thank you for reading all above and another thanks for brief guidance.
